                Ontario's Couples Resort is on the shores of Algonquin Park's Galeairy Lake, which mostly is in
                Algonquin
                Park and the Madawaska River. The village of Whitney, Ontario is a short 15-minute walk away. Algonquin
                Park being our backyard, we are surrounded with breathtaking wilderness, pure fresh air, secluded
                forests,
                pristine waters, an abundance of sunny days, and a blanket of stars at night.

            <p class="description">
                A 5-STAR Luxury Resort for 46 couples. Endless Nature and Sports Activities, together with Pampering Spa
                Treatments and followed by Decadent Gourmet dining by our International Chefs.

                Those of you who need to escape from the bustle will find us calming and rejuvenating. There are many
                ways
                to do
                nothing if that is your wish. On the other hand, unlimited activities will keep the adventurer active
                all
                year
                round. Ontario's Natural Algonquin Park is ideal for the sport enthusiast or avid adventurer who will be
                delighted with the extraordinary activities available.

                "Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort. Here you will find the time to spend quality time
                together,
                and this is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend lots of time together. We, the Sorensen
                Family,
                started in 1967 to take care of guests, in 1989 we moved to couples only (no kids and no
                meetings/conferences)
                as we knew that many couples needed special time together. In 2006, Canada Select which was rating 4000
                accommodation properties in Canada, decided we should join them because we were easily in the top 1%, a
                5
                Star,
                and we are glad we made it for you to enjoy as you deserve it. Now, many times of the year, we offer
                rates
                super discounted as we wish to be accessible to as many couples as possible, as all couples should
                benefit
                from
                quiet time together. We have learned over the decades from our guests that those guests that have a love
                for
                gratitude for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, daily I ask how grateful am
                I,
                and
                I hope you are filled with many things that you are grateful for. If you know other couples who need
                time
                away
                please pass on the word."

                Your Hosts, The Sorensen Family & Team The Couples Resort, Ontario - Canada
                FYI * #1 Romantic Resort in Ontario. Defined by when we were paying TripAdvisor over $10,000 a year to
                belong
                to them they rated us #1 in Ontario. The moment we stopped paying them the annual fee we were completely
                dropped
                from their list. We refuse to have TripAdvisor use Extortion on us to belong to their listings. Yet
                TripAdvisor
                continues to still publish the reviews, and this is ethically just wrong as they are using their Power
                to
                Punish
                us and this is Blackmail. Hope you agree with us.

                <h4>Gertrud Sorensen - Artist</h4>
                <p>Gertrud Sorensen is an Austrian-born Canadian. After a successful business career with Danish husband
                    Fritz,
                    at The Bear Trail Couples Resort, she became our resident artist. Gertrud presently operates an
                    extensive
                    art studio with over 30 paintings in her gallery. https://www.gertrudsorensen.com<br>

                    The four Algonquin seasons are portrayed with varying moods in vibrant colours on her canvases.
                    Having
                    learned from Poul Thrane, David Armstrong, Gladys Ewing, Mary Lampman and Ron Leonard, it is easy to
                    appreciate how they and the nature of Algonquin Park have influenced Gertrud's art.<br>

                    Visit Gertrud's on-site studio while you are here and enjoy her artwork. Wander in and watch a
                    canvas come

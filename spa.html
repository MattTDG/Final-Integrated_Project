            <p>Touching is healing; from a motherâ€™s touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete
                patted
                on the back by fellow athletes. Based on the same principle as human touch, massage is the oldest method
                of
                promoting good health, suppleness and strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the
                general
                public and other health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative. Due to public
                perception and desire, massage therapy has grown into a more prominent position. It is a viable and
                respected
                profession promoting good health not only for your physical but emotional well being also. Massage
                Therapy
                is
                the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and friction of the body. Whether it is
                for
                treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation, the skilled use of massage through touch is used to
                maintain
                and
                enhance the health and well being of the entire body. Experience the benefits massage can offer you.</p>

                an
                alternative time in the day or during your stay with another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly
                different Treatment. We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen
                circumstances.

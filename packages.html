                Installed new throught the Resort: 26 new GREEN Canadian Made 15” Cushion Euro Top Beds

                All mattresses are incased in a anti bed bug sealed sleeve

                Installed new: Bamboo flooring in all 9 Grand Cabins at our sister Lodge, the Adventure Lodge

                Installed new: 24 Solar Panels at the Couples Resort are now providing power to offset hot water usage
                in
                our most Opulent accommodations: the Master's Junior Suites and in our Salt Water Swimming Pool. We are
                seeing offsetting costs to Oil Consumption. Oil is used here at quite a substantial higher price than
                natural gas as natural gas is unavalable to us.

                The old 1999 maintenace truck was taken away to be recycled and a new 2010 was purchased which will
                greatly
                reduce carbon emissions, by its new technologies.

                Re-paving was completed on 1/4 of our driveway in the spring of 2010 and the old surface was taken away
                to
                be recycled.
